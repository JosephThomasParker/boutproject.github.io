# Manual

The [user manual](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~bd512//bout/user_manual.pdf) describes how to get started with BOUT++, and how the code works (or should work / did work) from the
point of view of someone who hasn't used BOUT++ before. There are separate developer and coordinate system manuals which are useful when you need to dig further into how the code works.

# Wiki page

A [wiki page](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT/wiki) with basic instructions on downloading and installing BOUT++ is available [here](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT/wiki).

# Workshops

BOUT++ workshops have been a mixture of hands-on training sessions, and discussion of current issues and research topics. The mission of the workshops are (1) to prepare researchers to use and further develop the BOUT++ code for edge turbulence, transport, and ELM simulations of magnetic fusion devices; and (2) to promote effective collaboration within the BOUT community and beyond.

The slides for (almost) all presentations are available on the workshop websites:

* [2015 workshop, York](workshop2015.html)
* [2014 workshop, York](workshop2014.html)
* [2013 workshop, LLNL](https://bout2013.llnl.gov/) 
* [2011 workshop, LLNL](https://bout2011.llnl.gov/)
