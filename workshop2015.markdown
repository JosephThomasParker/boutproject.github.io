# BOUT++ workshop 2015

**Date**: 14th-16th September 2015

**Location**: Fusion Learning Studio, University of York, UK YO10 5DQ

The BOUT++ code is a flexible tool for the simulation of plasma fluid equations, primarily focussed on tokamak edge simulations. This workshop will combine hands-on training in using BOUT++ with lectures on tokamak edge physics, numerical simulation techniques, and related topics. All those with an interest in using BOUT++ or in tokamak edge simulation, are invited to attend. There is no fee.

The aim of this workshop is (1) to prepare researchers to use and further develop the BOUT++ code for edge turbulence, transport, and ELM simulations of magnetic fusion devices; and (2) to promote effective collaboration within the BOUT++ community and beyond.

**Registration**: Anyone interested in attending should contact Ben Dudson (benjamin.dudson@york.ac.uk) by August 31st.
