Stellarator devices like [Wendelstein 7-X](http://www.ipp.mpg.de/w7x) confine plasmas in a twisted 3D magnetic field,
whose shape makes modelling more challenging than in tokamaks. Addressing this is an area of active development for BOUT++,
mainly using the Flux Coordinate Independent (FCI) approach.
