Simulates merging of two filaments of plasma through magnetic reconnection, using a 2D zero-beta model in Cartesian geometry. 
The vorticity and electromagnetic potential are evolved with a constant density and temperature. The magnetic field consists
of a constant “toroidal” field, and a time-evolving “poloidal” field.
