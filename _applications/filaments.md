At the edge of tokamak (and other) plasmas, isolated "blobs" of plasma are often observed,
typically moving outwards at a few hundred meters per second. These blobs are elongated along the magnetic
field, forming long filaments. These single filaments have a surprisingly complicated range of nonlinear
behaviour.

The [blob2d model](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/tree/master/examples/blob2d) simulates isothermal
blobs with a sheath closure, and includes example inputs to get started. This is quite a good place to start
learning how to use BOUT++ with a "real" physics model.
