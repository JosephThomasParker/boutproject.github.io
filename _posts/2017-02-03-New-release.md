On Friday, I pushed the release candidate to the master branch,
officially releasing BOUT++ v4.0.0! Thanks to everyone who contributed
to this release, I know it's been a bit of a slog, but it's finally
here!

We now have documentation online at [readthedocs][latest]. This is
currently a combination of the user and developer manuals and is built
off the next branch. You can also see a version built from
the [latest release][stable] (i.e. currently 4.0.0).
